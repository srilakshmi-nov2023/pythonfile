What is DevOps?
It's a Concern various teams involved in this

Application Team(Development Team)
Build & Release Management
Infrastrurture Team
Testing Team

[There are various types of applications]

Standalone Application
----> Sta
Design to run local machine


Web Applications --> The application which is hosted in a remote machines different servers
  --Static Web Application ---->GUI/UI (Graphincal User Interface) -->UI /FrontEnd Developers

Types of cloud computing

1)Public cloud
   public clouds are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service providers, which deliver their computing resources like servers and storage over the internet.
ex: AWS,Microsoft Azure,GCP 

2)Private cloud

A private cloud refers to cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single business or organisation. A Private cloud can be physically located on the company's on-site(premise) datacenter. Some complanies also pay third-party service providers to host their private cloud.

3)Hybrid cloud
   Hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them. By allowing data and applications to move between private and public clouds, a hybrid cloud gives your business greater flexibility, more deployment options and helps optimise your existing infrastructure,security and compliance.

4)Multi cloud
    Multi-cloud is a startegy where an organiszation leverages two or more cloud computing platforms various tasks. Organizations that do not want to depend on asingle cloud provider may choose to use resources from several providers to get the best benifits from each unique service.

Cloud Service Models:
   IAAS(Infrastructure as a service)
  PAAS(Platform as a service)
  SAAS(Software as a service)
